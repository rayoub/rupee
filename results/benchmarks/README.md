## Benchmarks 

Following is a list of the benchmarks used to evaluate the performance of RUPEE.

#### scop_d500

Identical to d500 used in the mTM paper.

#### scop_d499

Subset of d500 that is defined in SCOP 2.07. 
This excludes *d4pwvb_*, which is defined in SCOP 2.06 but not SCOP 2.07.

#### scop_d437

Subset of d499 that includes all domains for which mTM returns greater than or equal to 50 SCOP 2.07 domain results. 

#### scop_d360

Subset of d437 that includes all domains for which mTM returns greater than or equal to 100 SCOP 2.07 domain results. 


#### scop_d100

Subset of d360 including the first 100 domains. Used for development testing. 

#### scop_d50

Subset of d360 including the first 50 domains. Used for development testing.
